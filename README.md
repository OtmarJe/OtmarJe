Dear visitor üçÄ 
I welcome you on my gh-page!üåº <br>
‚û§ Isn't the internet full of straight lines, right angles and corners? Rather rigid - seen that way. So in my "Holosophy" project I worked with childlike illustrations. All very colourful and quite different from what designers usually do. But see for yourself: [Click here please](https://otmarje.github.io/Holos/hsophy2/)<br>
‚û§ As a participant of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp (2021), I co-developed the app "cargo". "cargo" is designed as an alternative delivery service. The fonts and graphic elements are unobtrusive and are intended to serve comprehensibility and usability without exception. The project is implemented with Ruby on Rails, has a chat and geolocation. As mvp, "cargo" is finalised from development to production. [Click here](https://www.cargo-delivery.de/)<br>
‚û§ Another project we finalised was "Farmily - how to rent a farming animal". Ever dreamed of having a pig on your balcony? They are very nice, clean and also very smart. So, if you are interested now - "Farmily" is unfortunately still a prototype. But maybe someone will take up this idea now ... [Click here](https://github.com/jennyglassmyer/farmily)<br>
Always happy if you reach out to me
